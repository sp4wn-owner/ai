# AI Memory System

- Our memory system provides the foundation for self-learning AI. Leverage our system to teach your AI associations between visual and audio stimuli. For example, hold up an apple and say "apple". Next time the AI sees an apple, it may remember bits of the audio of you saying apple, but it can be rather forgetful so repeated similar experiences will help develop stronger associations. Currently, with over 100 configurable parameters, each AI will truly be unique.
